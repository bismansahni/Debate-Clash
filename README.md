# AI Debate Arena

Drop any topic. AI agents argue every side. AI judges score them. You get the verdict.

I built this as a fun project to learn Inngest and its orchestration system — coordinating multiple AI agents across a multi-phase workflow turned out to be a great way to explore what Inngest can do.

## How It Works

1. You submit a topic — anything from "should college be free" to "is remote work better"
2. The system analyzes the topic and creates AI debaters with distinct personalities, backgrounds, and arguing styles — could be two agents, could be more depending on the topic's complexity
3. They go through a full structured debate: opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttals, audience questions, lightning round, and closing statements
4. Three AI judges (logic, evidence, rhetoric) deliberate and score each agent
5. A winner is declared

## What Makes It Interesting

- The debaters aren't generic — they get names, backstories, catchphrases, and weaknesses. They quote each other, make concessions, and land zingers.
- Cross-examination forces real engagement — pointed questions, strategic evasions, counter-attacks.
- Lightning round strips away the fluff — binary choices, forced commitments, no hedging allowed.
- Judges have distinct personalities and judging philosophies. They disagree with each other.
- Momentum shifts in real time as the debate progresses.

## The Debate Phases

**Pre-Show** — Context, stakes, and odds before the debate starts.

**Opening Statements** — Each agent presents their full case.

**Cross-Examination** — Two rounds. Each agent gets to grill the other with pointed questions.

**Rebuttals** — Direct responses to the opponent's arguments. Must quote and engage, not dodge.

**Audience Questions** — AI-generated audience personas ask uncomfortable questions from different perspectives.

**Lightning Round** — Rapid-fire questions that force binary answers. No "it depends."

**Closing Statements** — Final pitch. No new evidence. Pure persuasion.

**Judge Deliberation & Verdict** — Three judges score independently. Scores revealed one at a time for suspense.
